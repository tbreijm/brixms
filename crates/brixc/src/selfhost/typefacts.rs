//! Ingestion bridge from `brix_ir::reflect`'s structural facts into the
//! native `brix.type` shadow-mode package's Ground relations (#15 vertical
//! slice 1: "native `brix.type` vertical slice 1").
//!
//! `reflect::analyze` produces content-addressed, `Ty`/`Subject`-shaped
//! facts. The native package only ever runs an `engine::Store` — its rows
//! are `String -> engine::Value`, and this module never hands a
//! `Subject`/`Ty` to the engine directly: it flattens each to an **opaque
//! canonical token** (`Value::Str(hex(digest))`, the same content-addressing
//! style `FactId::derive`/`ScopeId::root` already use) and records a `token
//! -> (Subject|Ty|ScopeId)` side table ([`TokenTable`]) so the harness can
//! map a derived row's tokens back to the original values and call
//! `FactId::derive` itself — literal `FactId` set equality, no second
//! encoder (R1/R2 of the #15 slice-1 ruling).
//!
//! #15 native slice 2 (var-at-two-roles, Fable ruling comment 5012408628)
//! adds the package's first non-`Str` column: `Fact::RoleVar::ordinal` is
//! plain structure (a zero-based occurrence index), exported as
//! `Value::Int` directly rather than tokenized — R1 still holds, since rules
//! only ever match it against a literal (`ordinal: 0`) or copy it, never
//! construct or interpret one.
//!
//! Rules in `packages/brix.type/brix.type.brix` only ever *join on* and
//! *copy* these tokens (and the `ordinal` int); they never construct or
//! interpret one — that discipline lives entirely on this side of the
//! bridge.
